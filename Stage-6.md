This is a common repository settings issue, not a problem with your workflow file.

The error log is very specific:
**`Error: GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests.`**

This means your repository settings are overriding the `permissions:` block in your workflow. You have given the workflow permission, but the repository itself is blocking the action.

---

### **How to Fix It**

You need to change your repository settings to allow Actions to create pull requests.

1.  In your GitHub repository, go to the **"Settings"** tab.
2.  In the left sidebar, click **"Actions"**, then **"General"**.
3.  Scroll down to the **"Workflow permissions"** section.
4.  You likely have "Read repository contents permission" selected. You have two ways to fix this:

    * **Option 1 (Recommended):**
        Keep "Read repository contents permission" selected, but check the box below it that says **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**.

    * **Option 2 (Broader):**
        Change the setting to **"Read and write permissions"**. This will also work, as it gives the `GITHUB_TOKEN` write access to contents, pull requests, and more.

5.  Click **"Save"**.

---

### **Next Step**

After you save these settings, you must **trigger the workflow again**:

1.  Go back to the **"Issues"** tab.
2.  Create a **new issue** with the **`autocoder-bot`** label.

This time, the workflow will have the correct repository-level permissions and the "Create Pull Request" step should succeed.
------


```
The commit was not made by 'autocoder-bot' with the email 'actions@github.com'. Found name: 'akatore', email: '65213016+akatore@users.noreply.github.com'.
```
This error means the `create-pull-request` action is not using the Git configuration you set in the previous step. It's defaulting to the user associated with the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, which is you (`akatore`).

The good news is you can fix this by **passing the author and committer information directly** to the `create-pull-request` action.

### **The Fix: Update Your Workflow**

Modify the `Create Pull Request` step in your `.github/workflows/autocoder.yml` file to include the `author` and `committer` inputs.

```yaml
      # ... (steps for checkout, chmod, run script, configure git) ...

      # Objective: Commit code and Create Pull Request
      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v6
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          commit-message: 'feat: Add generated code for issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }}'
          title: 'Autocode: Fixes issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }}'
          body: |
            This PR was auto-generated by the autocoder-bot.
            It addresses issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }}.

          # --- ADD THESE TWO LINES ---
          committer: autocoder-bot <actions@github.com>
          author: autocoder-bot <actions@github.com>
          # ---------------------------

          # Objective: Set branch name, base, and labels
          branch: autocoder-branch-${{ github.event.issue.number }}
          base: main
          labels: autocoder-bot
```

### **Why This Works**

  * **`committer: autocoder-bot <actions@github.com>`**: This explicitly tells the action to make the commit using the name "autocoder-bot" and the email "actions@github.com".
  * **`author: autocoder-bot <actions@github.com>`**: This sets the author of the commit to the same values.

This overrides the default user and will satisfy the grader's requirement.

**Your next step:**

1.  Add these two lines to your workflow file.
2.  Commit and push this change to your `main` branch.
3.  Trigger the workflow again by **creating a new issue with the `autocoder-bot` label**.
